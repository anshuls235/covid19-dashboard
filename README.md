# COVID19 India Dashboard

A Dashboard akin to the Aarogya Setu app made solely using Python and Dash just
for the sake of learning.

The application is deployed on the web using Heroku.
[Click here](https://covid-dashboard-india.herokuapp.com/) to access the
dashboard.

In order to run the application on your local system, kindly follow the
following steps:-
- Download the repository.
- Move to the app folder in your cli.
- [Recommended] Create a virtual environment.
- Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Once the libraries are installed, run the command `python3 app.py`. This will
run the app on your local system.

> The app seems to run blazingly fast on the local system although it runs fine
on the heroku server.
