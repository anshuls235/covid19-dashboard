        ## Installation

        ## Getting started for contributors
        
        ```sh
        # Clone this repository
        git clone https://github.com/plotly/dash-daq.git
        
        # Install dependencies
        $ yarn
        
        # Watch source for changes and build to `lib/`
        $ yarn start
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        Component API documentation can be found at https://dash.plotly.com/dash-daq
        
        ## Development
        
        ### Demo server
        
        You can start up a demo development server to see a demo of the rendered
        components:
        
        ```sh
        $ yarn demo
        $ open http://localhost:9000
        ```
        
        You have to maintain the list of components in `demo/Demo.react.js`.
        
        ### Code quality and tests
        
        #### To run lint and unit tests:
        
        ```sh
        $ yarn test
        ```
        
        ### Testing your components in Dash
        
        1. Build development bundle to `lib/` and watch for changes
        
                # Once this is started, you can just leave it running.
                $ yarn start
        
        2. Install module locally (after every change)
        
                # Generate metadata, and build the JavaScript bundle
                $ yarn install-local
        
                # Now you're done. For subsequent changes, if you've got `yarn start`
                # running in a separate process, it's enough to just do:
                $ python setup.py install
        
        3. Run the Dash demo
        
                $ python demo.py
        
        
        ## Installing python package locally
        
        Before publishing to PyPi, you can test installing the module locally:
        
        ```sh
        # Install in `site-packages` on your machine
        $ yarn run install-local
        ```
        
        ## Uninstalling python package locally
        
        ```sh
        $ yarn run uninstall-local
        ```
        
        
        ## Producing a new release as a tarball
        
        ```sh
        vim dash_daq/version.py # and increase it to X.X.X
        rm -rf node_modules dist build lib
        yarn install
        yarn build-tarball
        ls dist/dash_daq-X.X.X.tar.gz # this is your tarball
        ```
